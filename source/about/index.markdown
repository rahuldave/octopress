I am a Computational Scientist at the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) at Harvard University in Cambridge, MA.

I have a Ph.D. in Physics (my thesis was about dark energy), and am a self-trained developer, with a particular taste for web programming. I like learning new programming languages. I've dabbled in multi-agent simulations, and economic geography. 

I tend to be a systems
thinker, and try and connect parts into a whole.
I worry incessantly about the connections between the physics, economics, and ecology of the earth. 
I feel most economists and engineers have mistaken their approximate models for the truth, or worse, have let ideology drive their efforts.

The sad
state of affairs in our country, both economic and ecologic, have drawn me into environmental and social-justice activism. As the anthropocene progresses, the connection of ecological destruction to human degradation will only become more stark.
 
I am available for projects related to computing with large or difficult sets of data, such as: managing large datasets, finding patterns in and visualizing data, understanding data and results of computation from science perspectives, and making the results of these available over the web. Contact me if you have interesting problems that you need help with: I can either help, or put you in touch with someone who can.

I am interested in social software, especially where it might create new, more democratic and responsible forms of media and journalism.

In the recent past, I was a computational scientist at Harvard’s Initiative in Innovative Computing.

I’m an avid climber and skier, and a mountain person at heart.
